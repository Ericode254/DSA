In this repo you will find many if not all the data structures and some algorithms implimented in the C programming language and with well illustrative comments to help you understand what is going on.

## Note
Some of the data structures or algorithms implimented here might not be that effective but feel free to alter any of them to suit your needs. I have used random data types in the implimentations.
